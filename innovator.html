                        <p id="biobiobio"> As a woman of color, Dr. Howard has faced many challenges in the STEM field. While studying at Brown University, she was aware of bias in her professors grading; white students would receive better marks than their equally intelligent peers of color. Due to her stubborn nature, Howard was able to persevere through this racism. Now, much of her work has had to do with confronting similar biases in artificial intelligence and robots.</p>
